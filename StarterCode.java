//The code should involve a wordle class and a main method

/* 
       public Wordle(String key)
       {
          this.key = key; //User selected the five letter word that is the answer
       }
 */
 
 /* In the wordle class, there should be methods that help run the game.
 
    public void getguess(): Here the user will receive a question that requires an input for their guess. This guess will be compared later to the answer
 */
 
 /* Other method would be public void checkguess(); Here, each char in the guessed word will be compared to each char in the key String.
   The code should determine which chars are included in the key string but is in the wrong position, right position, or not includes. 
   The code should print out three lines of statements like this: 
   
   The letters in the correct spots are: 
   The letters in the wrong spots are: 
   The letters not included are: 
 */
 
 /* In the checkguess method, as long as the guess string is not equal to the key string, they user will always be asked for an input. However, you need to 
 make sure that the user cannot be asked for an input more than six times. After the sixth try, the user will be notified with a message they lost. If the guess string
 becomes equal to the key string, a win message will be displayed for the checkguess method.
 */
 
 /* The user would run the methods of the class Wordle in the main method*/
